The Brandi Carlile Concert Tracker is an app for Brandi Carlile Band (BCB) Super Fans (Bramily) who want to keep track of all the BCB concerts they have been to. Most Bramily go to so many BCB concerts a year that it can be hard to keep track of all of them and to know the total attended. This website will allow the user to save, have a list, and have a total tally of all the BCB concerts they have attended. 

This website utilizes the following technologies:
  - Created and logged with GitHub
  - Rails on the back end, including the gems:
    - Devise for authorization and authentication
  - PostgreSQL 
  - Foundation
  - Third-Party API
  

Future features to come: 
  - React on the front end
  - RSpec and Capybara for testing
  - CarrierWave for file upload handling
  - Fog to interface with an AWS S3 bucket
  - Deploying through Heroku
